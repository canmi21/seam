# What a refusal means

The compiler refuses things. An author who meets one needs to know which of three situations they
are in, because the three ask for different actions, and until this file existed the compiler said
the same kind of thing for all of them.

## Every refusal is a compile-time error

**There is no runtime fallback.** A component the compiler cannot compile does not quietly get
rendered by Svelte at request time instead.

Three reasons, and the first is the only one that would still hold if the others changed.

**It would break the one promise the whole design rests on.** Rendering a component at request
time is running UI on the server, which is the thing compile-time rendering exists not to do. A
fallback that does it for some components does it, and the guarantee stops being one.

**A backend that is not Node could not do it at all.** A Rust server has no Svelte renderer and is
not going to acquire one, so a fallback would make two backends differ in which pages they can
serve. That is a divergence, and divergence is what this protocol governs.

**The cost of not having one is smaller than it looks.** Measured across what is refused today,
there is no category of *this will never work* -- see below.

## Not permanently. The condition is named

This is a decision for now, not for ever, and the thing that would reopen it is written down so
that reopening it is not a matter of mood.

**When compile-time and request-time rendering can both appear on one page** -- different
components on the same response, some compiled and some rendered -- the question becomes whether
to offer the choice to authors rather than whether the machinery could exist. That is when it gets
asked again. Until that machinery is ready the answer is no, and a refusal is an error.

## The three kinds, and what each has to say

One rule, three ways of saying it. This is the same shape as the decision in
[derivation.md](derivation.md) not to grade strictness by where a value lands: the distinction
lives in the diagnostic, never in a second set of rules.

| | what it means | what the message owes the reader |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **not implemented** | the shape is understood and measured, and nobody has written it | what it is, and that it is coming |
| **not decided** | the protocol has no answer and guessing would be worse than waiting | where the question is recorded |
| **not expressible as written** | there is a legal way to write this | **the other way of writing it** |

The third is the only one where the author can act now, so a message that leaves them without the
alternative has failed. `Date.now()` is refused because it does not read the same twice, and the
message that does not mention `$.now` has told them their code is wrong and nothing else.

## Nothing is outside on principle

The list of what is refused today falls entirely into the first two kinds:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `{#await}`, `{#key}`, an each with an index or a key, `{:else}` on an each | measured, trivial, unwritten |
| snippets, children, `{@render}` | inlining, which composition already does |
| `class:`, `style:`, `<select value>` | decidable by enumeration; deferred on what they are worth |
| `{...spread}`, `<svelte:element>` | an unenumerable decision, so a small closed runtime node |
| per-item derivation, which of two titles wins, who owns CSS | not decided |

**So "a subset of Svelte" is a statement about how far the work has got, not about where a line
was drawn.** The subset grows, and the README should say that rather than implying a boundary
nobody has found.

One thing is not looked at closely enough to be listed either way. **Context** -- `setContext` and
`getContext` -- writes nothing structural into the bytes, but where its value comes from would
need a compile-time walk of the component graph that has never been attempted here. It may turn
out to be ordinary. It has not been shown to be.

## Raw HTML is not escaped at all, and cannot usefully be

Three things happen to `{@html data.x}` and none of them is escaping.

**At compile time the name is checked and the value is not.** Binding resolution says `data.x`
resolves to something the data carries. It says nothing about what is in it.

**At request time the bytes go out untouched.** `escape: false` is not a lighter escape than the
other two, it is none: the value is turned into a string and written.

**Whether that is safe is the author's.** That much is where React and Svelte both stand -- one
encodes the warning in the name of the prop, the other says in its documentation that it
sanitizes nothing -- but agreeing with them is the weakest reason available, and there is a
stronger one.

**Sanitizing on the server would not make the page safe.** Svelte's client does not re-render
`{@html}` while hydrating; it walks from the opening anchor to the closing one and adopts
whatever is there, saying so in a comment: *we're deliberately not trying to repair mismatches
between server and client*. So a sanitized server rendering survives exactly until the value
changes, at which point the client assigns the raw value to `innerHTML` and replaces it.
Sanitizing here would buy no safety and would make the first frame disagree with every one after
it.

The only place sanitizing means anything is where the value is produced, which is the load stage,
and [derivation.md](derivation.md) puts that outside the protocol on purpose. That is not the
protocol declining a job it could do. It is the only place the job can be done.

The one place the decision is visible to a backend is `escape: false` on a `slot`, which means
write these bytes as they are. See [ir.md](ir.md).

**A development build is a separate output and is not produced.** Compiled with `dev`, Svelte
writes a hash of the value into the opening anchor so its client can warn when the two sides
disagree. A hash of the value is a decision position, so the compiler cannot write one, and what
it produces is the production form: an empty anchor, which the client's check returns from on its
first line. See [pipeline.md](pipeline.md) for what a sentinel can and cannot stand in for.
