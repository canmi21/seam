# @canmi/seam-injector

WASM bridge for the Rust HTML template injector, exposing `inject` and `injectNoScript` to Node.js/Bun.

> **Deprecated.** Use `@canmi/seam-engine` (`src/server/engine/js`) instead, which is a superset that includes injector functions plus page assembly, i18n, and build parsing.
