# seam-injector-wasm

WASM bindings for the SeamJS HTML template injector, compiled from [injector/rust](../rust/) via wasm-bindgen.

> **Deprecated.** Use `seam-engine-wasm` (`src/server/engine/wasm`) instead, which is a superset that includes injector functions plus page assembly, i18n, and build parsing.
